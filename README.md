# ArduinoMeteo
 This is a simple weather station with ASCOM driver for astronomical purpose.
 It's based on an Arduino UNO.

 The actual arduino code works with the following sensor:
 - I2C:
   - **TSL2591**: Luxometer for SQM reading
   - **MLX90614**: Infrared sky temperature for clouds 
 - SPI:
   - **BMP280**: Ground temperature and pressure
     - MISO: Pin 12
     - MOSI: Pin 11
     - SCK:  Pin 13
     - CS:   Pin 10 
 - Digital:
   - **DHT22**: Humidity (Pin 5). 10KÎ© resistor between the Data pin and the VCC pin.

I made a simple PCB, but has some bugs. The I2C_1 can't be used because it touch the Arduino UNO USB.
The PCB has free I2C and digital ports for future upgrades (wind velocity sensor, rain sensor, etc).
